TODO:

(800 x 500)

PRIORITY:

- logic to make it so that one dealer card is down and one shown until the right time 
- start to implement dealer and player logic functions (hit, stand, doouble down)
- when hit is called spawn a third card and shift positions
- error check deal button so that when bet placed == 0 , prompts you to make bet of at least 1
- implement home button that wipes game and restarts and goes to home

Lower priority: 
- maybe a restart button that just resets the game 
- maybe a minus or undo button to subtract from bet amount or something similar
