TODO:

(800 x 500)

PRIORITY:

- implement determine win function and in cases other than bust, when round end happens, spawn keep playing button
- figure out how and make a function to reset player and dealer hands so when in_game_setup is called after a round, you get new Cards
- same ^ but for when home is clicked, call that function to reset the cards

ALEC:
- implement home button that wipes game and restarts and goes to home - kinda done 

- figure out how to reset round - kinda done
- implement determine_win function - setup but failed to implement
---------------------------------------------------

- refactor code to fit the state-driven architecture (see constants.rs: GameRoundState; game.rs; for references) - started this

- figure out how to go to betting state once round ends - kinda done 
- figure out how to transition from round end - rund start 


Lower priority: 
- maybe a restart button that just resets the game 
- maybe a minus or undo button to subtract from bet amount or something similar 
- add a delay for each card when playing out the dealer hand


tests for button clicks, game state for different actions, if you bust, test we go to round end
deal test to go to playing

unit tests....
test 

write one for a system using logic on entities 
test something really small using only one entity
