TODO:

PRIORITY:

1)
- unit test

2)
- readme

3)
- Presentation

4) if we have time to try...
- implement determine win function and in cases other than bust, when round end happens, spawn keep playing button
- figure out how to wipe player hands so that when new round refresh happens, cards arent same as last round

recently completed:

- comments [X]
- documentation [X]


 ------------------------------------------------
- refactor code to fit the state-driven architecture (see constants.rs: GameRoundState; game.rs; for references) - started this

- figure out how to go to betting state once round ends - kinda done 
- figure out how to transition from round end - rund start 


Lower priority: 
- maybe a restart button that just resets the game 
- maybe a minus or undo button to subtract from bet amount or something similar 
- add a delay for each card when playing out the dealer hand


tests for button clicks, game state for different actions, if you bust, test we go to round end
deal test to go to playing
