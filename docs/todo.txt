TODO:

(800 x 500)

PRIORITY:

[X] logic to make it so that one dealer card is down and one shown until the right time 
[X] start to implement dealer and player logic functions (hit, stand, doouble down)
[X] when hit is called spawn a third card and shift positions
[X] error check deal button so that when bet placed == 0 , prompts you to make bet of at least 1
- implement home button that wipes game and restarts and goes to home
- maybe a text for how much you won/lost 
- refactor code to fit the state-driven architecture (see constants.rs: GameRoundState; game.rs; for references)
- figure out how to reset round
- implement determine_win function
Lower priority: 
- maybe a restart button that just resets the game 
- maybe a minus or undo button to subtract from bet amount or something similar 
- add a delay for each card when playing out the dealer hand
